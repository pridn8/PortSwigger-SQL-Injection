Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data
This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:
Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter.
Modify the category parameter, giving it the value '+OR+1=1-- 
Add this '+OR+1=1--  in web-security-academy.net/filter?category='+OR+1=1--

Submit the request, and verify that the response now contains one or more unreleased products.
Now all the released and unreleased products are displayed
